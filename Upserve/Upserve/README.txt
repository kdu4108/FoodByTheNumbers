Upserve Dataset

Upserve collects numerous data points for a restaurant from its Point of Sale and payments processing products. This dataset contains restaurant sales in 2017 by shift (breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night) and item category (i.e. food, alcohol). The restaurants are randomly selected and are located in one of the four Census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West).

Data fields:
• date
• dailySales
• itemCategorySales {beer, wine, food, liquor}
• shiftSales {breakfast, lunch, dinner, late}
• region
• restaurantUid

Some interesting projects could be: 
* Seasonal impact on late night sales
* Geographic heat map of brunch popularity
